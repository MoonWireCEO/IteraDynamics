## Strategy Logic

### Entry Conditions (All must be true)
1. Price > 200 SMA + 3% buffer (confirmed uptrend)
2. 50 SMA > 200 SMA (trend confirmation)
3. 200 SMA is rising (momentum check)

### Exit Conditions (Any triggers exit)
1. Price < 200 SMA (trend breakdown)
2. 50 SMA < 200 SMA (trend reversal)
3. Price drops 12% from peak (trailing stop)
4. Position down 10% from entry (hard stop)

### Position Sizing
- Deploy 75% of capital per trade
- Maintain 25% cash buffer for safety

## Key Parameters

```python
RegimeTrendParams(
    regime_sma=200,         # Long-term trend
    confirm_sma=50,         # Confirmation
    entry_buffer_pct=3.0,   # Enter 3% above SMA
    exit_buffer_pct=0.0,    # Exit at SMA
    position_size_pct=75.0, # 75% deployment
    use_trailing_stop=True,
    trailing_stop_pct=12.0, # 12% trail from peak
    max_loss_pct=10.0,      # 10% hard stop
)
```

## Trade Characteristics

- **Average Trade:** Moderate wins, small losses
- **Exit Reasons:**
  - 96% regime-based (trend breakdown)
  - 3% trailing stop (profit protection)
  - 1% hard stop (capital protection)
- **Time in Market:** ~35% (defensive)

## Why This Strategy Works

1. **Trend Following**: BTC trends hard in both directions. Being long during bull markets captures the big moves.

2. **Capital Protection**: The combination of:
   - Waiting for confirmation (3% above SMA)
   - Trailing stop (12% from peak)
   - Hard stop (10% from entry)
   ...prevents catastrophic losses

3. **Simplicity**: Simple rules don't overfit. This strategy has few parameters and clear logic.

4. **Cost Efficiency**: ~23 trades/year means low transaction costs.

## Risks & Limitations

1. **Still has -38% drawdown**: While better than B&H (-77%), this is aggressive by traditional standards. Suitable for investors who can stomach volatility.

2. **Lower return capture**: Only captures ~21% of BTC's upside. Trade-off for reduced risk.

3. **Long underwater periods**: Can go 800+ days without new highs during bear markets.

4. **Backtest only**: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results.
